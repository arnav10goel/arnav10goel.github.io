Hi! I am Arnav, a final year undergraduate at IIIT Delhi, where I am pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I am working as a Research Intern at the [INK-Lab](https://inklab.usc.edu/index.html), under the guidance of [Dr. Xiang Ren](https://www.seanre.com/). In parallel, I serve as a Research Assistant at McGill University and MILA, supervised by [Dr. Jackie Chi Kit Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/). My work here includes a collaboration with the FATE Team at Microsoft Research Montreal. In the past, I have been fortunate to work under [Dr. Sameep Mehta](https://research.ibm.com/people/sameep-mehta) and [Dr. Nishtha Madaan](https://nishthaa.github.io/) from IBM Research India and [Dr. Anubha Gupta](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/anubha) and [Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://midas.iiitd.ac.in/) at IIIT Delhi. 

My research interests span language models, machine learning, and speech processing. I am dedicated to enhancing the trustworthiness and fairness of large language models (LLMs), with a particular focus on how long-tail distributions in pre-training data influence their memorization and generalization capabilities. Furthermore, I am actively engaged in investigating multilinguality in natural language systems with an aim to make more robust models on low-resource languages. My past experience also includes work on vision-language models and the evaluation of models in scientific question answering and reasoning tasks. Additionally, I have a keen interest in conversational speech systems, especially in the areas of prosody transfer and representation learning in audio.

A full list of my publications is available at [this link](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PPozs9sAAAAJ&hl=en). If you are interested in collaborating, feel free to hit me up!
